Workflow:
In FIJI load up the .ome.companion file
Duplicate Venus stack
Save as 3D_filename_Venus_raw
Run CLAHE_stack script
Save as 3D_filename_Venus_CLAHE
Max Z project
CLAHE
Threshold in FIJI
Invert LUT
Process > Noise > Despeckle
Save as 2D_filename_Venus_FIJI_threshold
Duplicate Chlorophyll stack from original data
Save as 3D_filename_chlorophyll_raw
Run CLAHE_stack script
Save as 3D_filename_chlorophyll_CLAHE
Max Z project
Run CLAHE
Save as 2D_filename_chlorophyll_CLAHE

Go to MATLAB

Go through MAIN_AvgCondensateProperties_2D_20240124.m for each stack
Sometimes will need to set Tc in FUNC_CellFinder2D_Tiff.m

Then plot the data sets
PLOT_CondensateProperties_20240129
